                    My name is Josep Cortes Mañanich, I am 27 years old, and I am a proactive person always willing to adapt to new changes. Some of these changes have driven my search for a new path in my professional career, which is web development. I build my projects with empathy, creativity, and total dedication to the challenges that arise.

                    My educational journey began with a scientific bachelor degree, and upon graduating, I decided to delve into the world of chemical engineering. Therefore I enjoy it, I decided to hold on, due to economic reasons. However, when Covid-19 hit and I lost my job, I came up with decision to continue my education. Thus, I had to find a job where I could balance both: study and work, so I started working at Ametller Origen, where I am currently employed.

                    My first steps in development were taken when I enrolled at Ironhack, where I learned most of what I know about web development, mastering the use of JavaScript and the React.js library on the frontend. I also delved into backend development with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB database. I successfully connected a backend with a frontend, performing all its functions: authentication, CRUD operations, contacting an external API, and creating one.
                    Considering myself an ambitious person, I have decided to pursue a higher degree in Multimedia Application Development, remotely at 'Universitat Oberta de Cataluña'. I came up with a decision because to improve my skills and  increase my level of development.
                    Through my work experience and education. I have developed strong  skills in JavaScript  , being able to afford any problems. Also, I am good in listening, which aids to  my ability in understanding a situation and prepare an appropiate response.
                    I am sure that previous experience will help me pick up new skills and quickly excel.
